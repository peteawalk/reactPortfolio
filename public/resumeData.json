    "bio":"Hi, I'm Peter and I hail from Anchorage > Washington DC > Kansas City. I am currently enrolled in the KU Coding Boot Camp in which I am learning Full-Stack Development, which has grown as even more of a passion. I have a fascination with figuring out how things work and love working in the tech industry. In my current role I provide application and system support. I enjoy working on the command line and prefer RHEL, but have experience with other Unix flavors as well. I have many hobbies and interests which include: wood working, Linux automation, Raspberry Pi builds, DIY projects, power tools, home renovations, 3D-Printing, mountain biking, photograpy, and more! 🥧 🚴 📷 🏠",
